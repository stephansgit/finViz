finViz Package
------------------

This is a supposed to be a collection of code snippets and functions related to visualization of financial data. It heaviliy builds on other packages and is work in progress (as you can see, since it only contains one function)...
It can be installed from within R using `install_github("stephansgit/finViz")` (which requires the `devtools` -package to be installed).
